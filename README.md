# Ethereum Crawler

This Python application crawls Ethereum blochain using the Etherscan API. It allows you to see all transactions (Tx) from and to address from given block number that is taken as input from user.

**Only last 10000 can be obtained for particular address since that is api's constraint. Also I have set value of maximum 100 Tx for 1 page to be fetched but it can be easily edited to some other value.


## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ethereum-crawler.git
cd ethereum-crawler
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Set Up `.env` File

You need to create a `.env` file to securely store your **Etherscan API key**.

- Copy the provided `example.env` file:

```bash
cp example.env .env
```

- Open the `.env` file in a text editor and replace the placeholder `<YOUR_ETHERSCAN_API_KEY>` with your actual Etherscan API key.

### 4. Obtain Etherscan API Key

To obtain your **Etherscan API key**, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Etherscan API](https://etherscan.io/apis) page.
2. Sign up or log in to your Etherscan account.
3. Navigate to **API Keys** and click **Create New API Key**.
4. Copy the generated key and paste it into your `.env` file under the `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` variable.

### 5. Run the Application

After setting up the `.env` file, you can start the crawler by running the following command:

```bash
python app.py
```

The app will start, and youâ€™ll see the input field where user can set address, after that it will show console output as table of all Tx with given address.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure your `.env` file is **not committed to version control**. You can add `.env` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits.
- You can refer to the [Etherscan API documentation](https://etherscan.io/apis) for more details on available API endpoints and parameters.
